**Project Description**

This project is to be used as a guide to understand how arrays and subsequently
dynamic arrays work. 

The project includes the following -

1. DynamicArray.java
- This class represents the data structure in which describes the DynamicArray. It 
  contains methods to achieve the behaviours listed below:
  
  		- Add an integer to the end of an array
  		- Remove an integer from the end of an array
  		- Add an integer to a selected index of an array
  		- Remove an integer from the selected index of an array
  		- Print the logical size and capacity of the array
  		- Print the contents of the array
  		
2. Utilities.java
- This class contains utilities methods to assist in the execution of the program.

3. Main.java
- This class is the class to be invoked to run the program. The program itself is a 
  demonstration of the listed behaviours of the dynamic array listed above.
  
NOTE: This project can also be compiled and run without an IDE. Included is a build.xml
that allows the project to be compiled with Ant.

To compile the build, go to the project directory and locate the build.xml and type Ant build.xml.
By default, Ant expects the file to be called build.xml, thus simply invoking the command Ant will 
build the project.

To execute the project through the command line, run the following line - "java -jar dynamicArrays.jar"
