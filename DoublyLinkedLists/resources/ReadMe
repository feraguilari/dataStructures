**Project Description**

This project is a OO implemenation of a Doubly Linked List in Java. 

The three operations of the doubly linked structure (search, insertion and deletion) are maintained
within the DoublyLinkedList data structure. 

The idea to combine the functionality is to demonstrate how the data structure would operate under
a OO environment rather than to split the functionality up into separate classes. It is a simple
data structure so the code to perform the operations should not make the class to cluttered. 

The Node class is also a private inner class of the DoublyLinkedList such as to encapsulate the
data and functionality of the node within the list structure to avoid exposing the data directly.

A description of the following classes are outlined below -

1. Main.java

The main runnable, this class creates a DoublyLinkedList object and demonstrates the three
operations (search, insertion and deletion). It has no knowledge of the internal workings of
the DoublyLinkedList class and only passes raw data to it.     

2. DoublyLinkedList.java

Contains the implementation of the three doubly linked list operations (search, insertion, deletion).

Additionally the Node class has been added as a inner class of the DoublyLinkedList. This has been done
to hide the data and state from external classes.
