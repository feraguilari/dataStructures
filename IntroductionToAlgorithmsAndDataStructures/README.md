## Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

### Algorithms - 

An algorithm is defined as a procedure that takes a value or set of values and produces an output. It is a set of steps that convert an input into a particular output.

We use this in a computing context where the steps for an algorithm are performed by a machine. 

An example of this input and output relationship would be sorting a set of numbers. The sorting problem would be defined as follows -

- **Input** - 27, 45, 3, 9, 15, 1, 8
- **Output** - 1, 3, 8, 9, 15, 27, 45
 
The algorithm here would be the set of steps that would transform the unsorted input values into the sorted output values. 

### Algorithm Correctness

An algorithm is deemed as **correct** if for every piece of input, it provides the correct output. If an algorithm is not correct if it only provides the right answer for some input or none of the input. 

### Data Structures

A data structure is a way to store and organise data to allow easy access and modification of its contents. Depending on the type of problem, there can be many different data structures that can suit the purpose.

Real world examples of such data structures can be a rubbish bin, vending machine or a car stacker. Each of these structures can be used for different sorts of problems.
