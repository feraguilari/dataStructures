**Project Description**

This project is a combination of the three operations of a single linked list, combined
with OO (Object Orientated) concepts in Java.

There isn't much difference between the methods that were implemented previously and here. The 
majority of the operations have been imported from the SingleLinkedLists project into the class
SingleLinkedList.

The idea behind using OO concepts here to encapsulate the data contained within each node so that
it cannot be accessed directly from outside of the SingleLinkedList class. Therefore we are also not 
exposing the state of the node.

A description of the following classes are outlined below -

1. Main.java

The main runnable, this class creates a SingleLinkedList object and demonstrates the three
operations (search, insertion and deletion). It has no knowledge of the internal workings of
the SingleLinkedList class and only passes raw data to it.     

2. SingleLinkedList.java

Contains the implementation of the three single linked list operations (search, insertion, deletion).

The majority of the code used in this class is imported with some minor changes to demonstrate how the
three operations are combined and used within a OO environment.

Additionally the Node class has been added as a inner class of the SingleLinkedList. This has been done
to hide the data and state from external classes.
